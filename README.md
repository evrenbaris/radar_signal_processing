# Advanced Radar Signal Simulation

This project simulates radar signals and applies advanced signal processing algorithms such as Kalman filtering and FFT for noise reduction and target detection.

## Features
- Simulates noisy radar signals.
- Implements Kalman filtering for signal denoising.
- Uses FFT to analyze the frequency spectrum and identify targets.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations.
- **SciPy**: For FFT analysis.


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evrenbaris/advanced-radar-simulation.git
   cd advanced-radar-simulation
